This Memorial Wall, a relief map of the world, shows where NYC Transit Authority workers died during WW2\. In 2015 we moved the wall from 370 Jay Street to the lobby of the MTA at 130 Livingston, Brooklyn, NY. 

Ken Follett as former partner in Apple Restoration & Waterproofing, with subcontractor and friend Creighton Brown, moved the wall to the Jay Street exterior location in 1994\. 

The wall now installed at Livingston measures 15' wide, 11' tall and consists of 9 granite stones 2" thick and each weighing in at 500 lbs.

The project manager for the GC told us our rigging plan was Mickey Mouse, but he was an idiot. We lost a month with him having us run around looking for pre-tested portable cranes. Regardless we tested our cantilever rig, and we paid for a structural engineer to do calculations. Moving the stones off the wall with our rig was like playing with soft butter.

We undertook this project as a subcontractor to Jablonski Building Conservation. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/46513e42-f819-4022-97b7-0c7a11bd936b.jpg)

The stones were each individually crated and moved.

We had a hard time convincing the GC that we could rig off the steel armature. In the end that angle the chain fall is attached to cost us $6,000 between the metals fabricator and the structural engineer. The work area for the reconstruction was tight, all boxed in.

The Site Safety Engineer liked that we wore our PPE without him having to hassle us, and so he took this picture so that he could show others how to do it properly.

Due to flooding from Sandy the MTA had no records on how the wall was hung in 1994\. We were the only ones on the project with these drawings from the earlier move in 1994\.
